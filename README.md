![sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8c690b-584e-43d2-b52d-d2ca2f586268)

## Project Overview
The Social Media Sentiment Analysis project analyzes user-generated content across various social media platforms to identify sentiments and trends. The dataset includes posts from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, capturing emotions, hashtags, engagement metrics (likes, retweets), and timestamps. This dataset can be utilized for sentiment classification, trend analysis, and user engagement studies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple attributes that help in understanding social media sentiment trends.

Column	Description :-
Text  -	Content of the post
Sentiment  -	Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
Timestamp  -	Date and time of the post
User  - 	Username of the poster
Platform  -	Social media platform (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)
Hashtags  - 	Hashtags used in the post
Retweets  - 	Number of times the post was retweeted
Likes  - 	Number of likes received
Country  -	Country of origin of the post
Year  - 	Year the post was made
Month  - 	Month the post was made
Day  - 	Day of the post
Hour  - 	Hour of the post

## Key Concepts and Techniques
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to preprocess text data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Handling raw tweet data (hashtags, mentions, URLs) and transforming it into a format suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Using TF-IDF and word embeddings for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing classification models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM for sentiment analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.

## Future Work
In future improvements, additional techniques such as ensemble learning, feature engineering, or deep learning approaches could be explored to further enhance model performance.

## Conclusion
**Sentiment Distribution**
* The dataset consists of tweets categorized into different sentiment classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral, Indifference, Freedom, Friendship, etc.
* The majority of tweets fall under Neutral and Positive categories, while Negative sentiment is less frequent.
* Some custom sentiment labels like Indifference and Freedom suggest a non-traditional approach to sentiment classification.
  
**Engagement & Sentiment Impact**
* Positive tweets tend to receive more likes and retweets compared to negative ones.
* Negative tweets show higher engagement when they discuss trending or controversial topics.
* Tweets with hashtags and mentions tend to have better reach and engagement.
  
**Time-Based Sentiment Trends**
* Evening and late-night tweets have higher engagement (more retweets & likes).
* Sentiment distribution varies by day and monthâ€”weekends show a more positive tone, while mid-week tweets are more neutral or negative.
* Certain months (potentially event-driven) see spikes in positive or negative sentiments.
  
**Common Keywords & Word Cloud Insights**
* Positive tweets frequently contain words like "happy," "great," "love," and "enjoy."
* Negative tweets contain words like "bad," "disappointed," "hate," and "angry."
* Neutral tweets mostly consist of factual statements with minimal emotional words.
